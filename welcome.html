<!-- This welcome page is a little bit more complicated than the one on California.  It too has a banded design, but it uses a single page menu.  

Here is how it works -there are three elements to it:

First, the welcome_Menu.
    This is the menu for this page that sticks to the top of the screen as you scroll down.  It's pretty cool.  Instead of a URL in the <a href=""> part, put the symbol # and then the ID of the div section.  So if it is <div id="section-1"></div>  You would link to that with <a href="#section-1"></a>.
Second, the div sections:
    Each band or section of the page sits in a <div> tag.  This tag has to have two extra elements: an "ID" and a "data-magellan-target".  So the section-1 section would sit in a div that looks like this: <div class="section-1" id="section-1" data-magellan-target="section-1">

            <h3>When are your services?</h3>
            <p>You are always welcome to join us for any one of our services.  Here is some basic information about them:</p>
            <h3>Sunday Services</h3>

                <p>We have services every Sunday Morning at 10:30 AM and every Sunday Evening at 6:00 PM. We sing some hymns, pray together, and our pastor brings a message from the Bible. Our services rarely last longer than one hour and fifteen minutes.</p>

                <h3>Sunday School</h3>

                <p>We meet every Sunday at 9:30 AM for Sunday School. We have Sunday School classes for all ages and stages of life. Please check out our ministries page for more information about a Sunday School class.</p>

                <h3>Midweek Prayer Meeting</h3>

                <p>Every Wednesday at 7:00 PM we meet together for a time of fellowship and prayer. Our Wednesday services are more casual. We hear from a missionary (via video or a prayer letter), Pastor brings a very brief message on prayer, we take prayer requests and then we split up into various groups to pray. Childcare is provided.</p>

<p>No! Our offering is for our members and regular attenders. When the offering is passed please just let it go on by.</p>
